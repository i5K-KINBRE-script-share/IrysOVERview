Manual
============

Description 
-----------
Summarize and graph BioNano Genomics' Irys output

Developers
----------
Matthew Dry and Jonathan Kress are developing IrysOVERview with assistance from Nic Herndon and Jennifer Shelton from the Bioinformatics Core at Kansas State University 

Details
-------
Using the Irys platform from BioNano Genomics high resolution genome maps are assembled from ultra long molecules. More can be found about the Irys machine and service providers from the BioNano Genomics website http://www.bionanogenomics.com/ and the KSU Irys Genome mapping facility http://bioinformatics.k-state.edu/bionano.html. Uses for these maps include:
 
	▪	independent assembly validation
	▪	structural variation detection
	▪	scaffold extension
	

KSU is developing IrysOVERview as a tool to organize, summarize, visualize, and share quality metrics from each of our flowcell runs. IrysOVERview allows our facility to carefully monitor the quality of our output and test the efficacy of novel protocols. When development is complete we invite other mapping facilities to try IrysOVERview with their own machines.
